# 👋 Hey, I'm Ben

## 🎓 Who Am I?

I am a first class honours Master of Engineering (MEng) Computer Science graduate from the University of Southampton (2022) 🎉. In my final year I received a Dean's list award for outstanding academic achievement (> 80%). I specialize in full-stack development and love to work with diverse sets of technologies.

## 🛠️ Skills & Technologies

### Rust Projects
- [F1 Game Telemetry Library](https://github.com/11bthornton/f1-game-library) 🏎️: A Rust library for deserializing multiple versions of F1 Video game telemetry data. Supports both synchronous and asynchronous compilation options. I utilise 
- [Twitter for Rust](https://github.com/11bthornton/twitter-for-rust) 🐦: A Rust library for the Twitter API (written before Elon Musk got involved).
- [Discord Bot in Rust](https://github.com/11bthornton/discord_bot_rust) 🤖: A functional Discord bot written in Rust.

### Other Projects
